# Class Identity
The Sorcerer has ultimate control over the raw elemental magics to tear apart enemies. They let loose powerful torrents of destructive energy to snare and control the battle at any point. Strong defensive skills make them a deceptively hard target to kill. Further knowledge with Enchantment Slots bring a deeper diversity to their loadout of skills to leave nothing but destruction in their wake. The Sorcerer is fun to play with well-developed skills based around Cold, Lightning, and Fire. They also have amazing depth with seemingly endless skill interactions. Their skills are powered by Mana, a resource generated while in battle.


# Sorcerer Class
## Strengths
Screen Wide Damage. The Sorcerer's ability to dish out damage through AoE (Area of Effect) skills in unmatched with Core & Mastery Skills.
Crowd Control For Days. The CC capability of the Sorcerer to lock down enemies makes for a destructive combo with Legendary Aspects that grant additional damage.
Great Movement. Between Evade, ‍Teleport, and Legendary Aspects, the Sorcerer is a true master when it comes to getting out of danger.
Powerful Defensive Skills. While not designed to be as durable as the Barbarian, skills like ‍Ice Armor, ‍Flame Shield and ‍Teleport to name a few, can make the Sorcerer a deceptively hard target to kill.
Can DPS on the Move. With skills like ‍Hydra, ‍Blizzard and ‍Firewall, the Sorcerer can lead enemies to their death while gathering more monsters at the same time for efficient farming.
## Weaknesses
Mana Dependent. Mana is a precious resource and needs to be used wisely for maximum efficiency during combat.
Close Combat. While Sorcerer can withstand melee attacks with Defensive Skills for a short duration, prolonged exposure is not recommended as the class is simply not built for it.
Crowd Control Dependent Buffs. Picking too many CC effects and damage multipliers can leave you with a hard time on CC immune Champions and Bosses.
Few Party Abilities. There are only a few options the Sorcerer has to buff the party.
